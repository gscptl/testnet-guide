# Spacemesh Dictionary

## Account
Your Smesh "crypto bank account." By default, your Wallet is configured with one main account called `Main Account`. You use this account to hold SMH and to send and receive SMH. You can also add additional accounts to your Wallet.

## Address
Each account is identified by one unique `public address`. An address is displayed in a short-form such as this: `0xebee....ee0443`. The full account address is a long hexidecimal number such as: `0xebee4e63a6b0f829f3ad06fb6c4aa80a6860774bc25e9c1b1b2c69b8b4ee0443`. You can freely share your account's address with anyone.

## App
The App integrates the Wallet and the Smesher into one package that is delightful and easy to use even without deep technical understanding of cryptocurrency terms and concepts. The App is available for Windows 10, OS X and Linux systems that meet the [minimum system requirements](requirements.md).

## Free Disk Space Commitment
Disk space exclusively committed to the Spacemesh network. The amount of space is configured, and the commitment data is generated, as part of the one-time [set up](guide/setup.md) process. Note that the free space you commit to your Smesher is not used to store any useful data. It will be filled with cryptographic data that is only used to establish your node identity and your block Smeshing eligibility. You can use the disk space you committed to Spacemesh indefinitely.

## Rewards Account
Smeshing rewards are always sent to a specific wallet account. For this release of the Spacemesh App, this account is automatically set by the App for you when you [set up Smeshing](guide/setup.md) on your first App session.

## Smesh (SMH)
The name of the Spacemesh cryptocurrency for the Spacemesh Testnets. One Smesh equals one billion (10^9) Smidges. The App enables you to send and receive Smesh. See [About Smesh and Smidge](coins.md) for more units.

## Smesher
Smesher is the software package that maintains and updates the Spacemesh decentralized ledger according to the Spacemesh protocol. Smeshers form a p2p network by communicating with each other over the Internet.

The Spacemesh decentralized ledger is created and secured by people just like you who run a Smesher in the Spacemesh App on their desktop computers.

Your Smesher is responsible for submitting blocks with Smesh transactions to the network according to the Spacemesh protocol. We call this Smeshing. You earn Smeshing rewards for Smeshing.

The Spacemesh App for your desktop computer includes a Smesher and manages it for you. Future releases of the Testnet will support building and running a Smesher directly from source code.

## Smeshing
Smeshing is the process of submitting blocks with transactions to the Testnet network according to the Spacemesh protocol. Before you can Smesh blocks, you need to commit 4GB free storage on your computer hard drive to Spacemesh (for now; this amount will soon increase to 100GB).

You will be prompted to [set up Smeshing](guide/setup.md) when you run the App for the first time.

## Smeshing Rewards
Smesh are rewarded to those who run Smeshers on their computers and submit blocks with transactions to the network according to the Spacemesh protocol. To earn Smeshing rewards, you need to commit free space on your computer to Spacemesh and leave the app running 24/7 so it will Smesh for you when the protocol determines you are entitled to do so. See [Smesh Rewards](rewards.md).

## Smidge
The atomic (indivisible) unit of accounting in the Spacemesh ledger and platform. Transaction fees are displayed in Smidge units in the App. One billion (10^9) Smidges equals one Smesh (SMH). See [About Smesh and Smidge](coins.md) for more units.

## Transaction
A Smesh transaction (abbreviated "tx") is a transaction from one account (sender) to another account (recipient) in which a specific amount of SMH is transferred. Transactions are executed from the Wallet.

## Transaction Fee
All transactions must include a small transaction fee. For the Open Testnet, the transaction fee is range is 1-3 Smidge (SMD).

## Wallet
A basic Wallet used to work with Smesh accounts, execute Smesh transactions and check the status of incoming transactions initiated by other accounts designated to one of your account. The Wallet is bundled in the Spacemesh App.
