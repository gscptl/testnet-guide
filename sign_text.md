## Signing Text

`SIGN TEXT` allows you to sign a text message such as your full name or email address.
Signing is done with your account's secret key and requires access to it.
Signing your name with your account proves that the name is the name of the owner of the account.
As owner is defined as someone who has access to the account's secret key.

In order to use the `SIGN TEXT` feature, go to `SETTINGS`. Once there, notice the box on the left of the screen and click on `ACCOUNT SETTINGS`.

1. Under each account, you'll notice three commands: `RENAME`, `SIGN TEXT`, and `REWARDS ACCOUNT`. Click on the `SIGN TEXT` command.

The signature text is copied to the clipboard and can be sent to anyone.

4. Create an email or type a text message to the person you want to share the signature with and paste the signature copied to the clipboard in step 3.
